This is Kevin Short's kobo weather display application - see http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=194376&page=6

It is a copy of the code published at https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B6fzXeHwR9miLUNuMndLRDk0ZDQ.

I have used it as a suitable example of how to write to the kobo display.

Note:  I am not sure about the licence of this work.
